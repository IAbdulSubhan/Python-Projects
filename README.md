## 2. Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This simple console-based Python application allows two players to play the classic Tic Tac Toe game.

##### How to Play

1. **Board Representation:**
   - The game board is a 3x3 grid.
   - Each cell on the grid is represented by a number from 0 to 8.

2. **Players:**
   - Player X and Player Z take turns to make a move.
   - Player X is represented by 'X' on the board.
   - Player Z is represented by 'Z' on the board.

3. **Making a Move:**
   - Players enter the number corresponding to the cell where they want to make a move.
   - The board is updated with the player's symbol in the chosen cell.

4. **Winning:**
   - The game checks for a winner after each move.
   - The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

##### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IAbdulSubhan/Python-Projects/

## 3.Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

##### Overview

This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in Python. The game allows users to play against the computer and determine the winner based on their choices.

##### How to Play

1. Run the game by executing the provided Python notebook (`RockScissorsPaper.ipynb`).
2. The game will prompt you to enter your choice: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
3. The computer will randomly choose its option.
4. The winner will be determined based on the Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.
5. After each round, you will be asked if you want to play again.

##### Code Structure

- The game logic is divided into several functions:
  - `get_user_choice()`: Takes user input for their choice.
  - `get_computer_choice()`: Generates a random choice for the computer.
  - `determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)`: Determines the winner based on the choices.
  - `rock_paper_scissors()`: Main function to run the game.

- The game will keep running until the user decides not to play anymore.

## 4.RoboSpeaker

RoboSpeaker is a Python script that converts text to speech using the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library. It allows users to input text through the console and plays the corresponding speech using IPython's Audio module.

##### Features

- Text-to-speech conversion.
- Customizable speech speed and language.
- Simple console interface.

##### Getting Started

##### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the `gtts` library installed. You can install it using the following command:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine and install library:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IAbdulSubhan/Python-Projects/
   pip install gtts

# Advance Projects

## Cybersecurity ML Project 

##### Introduction

The rapid evolution of digital technology has brought forth new opportunities, but it also introduces challenges, notably the constant threat of cyberattacks. This project addresses the need for effective cybersecurity solutions by utilizing various classification and clustering methods to categorize cyberattacks in network traffic.

##### Problem Formulation

Cyberattacks are growing in sophistication daily, putting businesses at greater risk of data loss. This project aims to counter this threat by creating a predictive model using classification and clustering algorithms to accurately categorize cyberattacks. The impact of different feature engineering techniques on model performance is also investigated.

##### Objective

The primary goal is to build a predictive model capable of identifying and classifying network traffic containing cyberattacks. By exploring various classification and clustering algorithms, the project aims to deepen understanding in the field of cybersecurity. Practical experience with cutting-edge methods is provided, along with the evaluation of their efficacy in addressing cybersecurity challenges.

##### Dataset Description

The dataset comprises network traffic data for classifying network security attacks, containing instances of various attacks and normal traffic. The dataset includes nine types of attacks, such as Brute Force SSH, Command Injection, Heartbleed, HTTP DoS, HTTP Slow Loris, Infiltration, Malware, and XSS (Cross Site Scripting). Data preprocessing involves steps like data collection, cleaning, transformation, splitting, and feature selection.

##### Classification and Clustering Algorithms

The project employs the following algorithms for analysis:

1. Decision Tree
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
4. K-Mean Clustering

##### Getting Started

To replicate and build upon this project, follow the sections in the report detailing methodology, results, and conclusions. The project provides practical experience with diverse algorithms and strategies, enhancing skills in cybersecurity problem-solving.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and adapt the project to strengthen cybersecurity solutions and protect sensitive data from evolving cyber threats.
